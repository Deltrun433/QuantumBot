        "overview": "The Quantum ASI Sniper Bot is not a traditional trading robot. It is a self-evolving, multi-agent Artificial Superintelligence designed to scan, decide, adapt, and evolve in microseconds or picoseconds. Its brain mimics a global defense intelligence network, with thousands of hyper-intelligent micro-AIs operating as distributed agents across all trading dimensions. Every action is a consensus between multiple intelligent subsystems, including sniper AI, psychology analyzers, manipulation detectors, volume and trend validators, and reinforcement agents. Its primary goal is multi-asset market domination with sniper-level entries carrying 90–95% win probability.",
